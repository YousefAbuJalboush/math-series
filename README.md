# Lab: 02 - Modules, Containers, and Testing

## This project includes three functions:

* The Fibonacci Series is a numeric series starting with the integers 0 and 1. In this series, the next integer is determined by summing the previous two
* The Lucas Numbers are a related series of integers that start with the values 2 and 1 rather than 0 and 1.
* sum_series with one required parameter and two optional parameters. The required parameter will determine which element in the series to print. The two optional parameters will have default values of 0 and 1 and will determine the first two values for the series to be produced.
